# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-08

### Added

- Initial design document at `docs/filecap-design.md`.
- Project metadata: `README.md`, `LICENSE` (MIT), `.gitignore`, `CHANGELOG.md`.
- `filecap scan <directory>` command — recursive filesystem walk, per-file stats (size, mtime, extension), category derivation, optional SHA-256 hashing, and NDJSON output (header + entries + footer).
- `-o -` stdout-output convention: `filecap scan /path -o -` writes NDJSON to stdout, enabling SSH-piped multi-server orchestration without round-tripping files.
- Bounded concurrency for hashing via `p-limit`.
- Permission-denied handling: per-directory errors are captured and counted in the footer's `permissionDenials`; scan exits with code 3 (partial completion) when any directory was unreadable.
- TOCTOU resilience: files deleted between walk and stat are silently skipped; stat-level permission errors are counted alongside hash-level ones.
- Consistent error contract: `runScan` always returns `{exitCode, error?}`; never throws.
- Zod schemas validating header, entry, and footer NDJSON lines.
- Sample bash orchestrator at `examples/multi-scan.sh` for SSH-piped multi-server scans.
- Publish script (`./publish`) for npm releases.

### Design decisions locked

- **Output format.** NDJSON (`.ndjson`) for both single-instance scans and consolidated rollups.
- **Rollup canonical-row semantics.** One row per physical copy; content-duplicates carry a `duplicateOf` field (oldest `modifiedAt` wins; alphabetical tiebreaker on `serverName`). *(Implementation pending Phase 5.)*
- **PDF introspection failure handling.** Empty fields, no stub error block. *(Implementation pending Phase 2.)*
- **Hash algorithm.** SHA-256 via Node native `crypto`.
- **Vendor workflow.** Out of scope. filecap is a pure inventory tool.
- **CSV column additions.** `category`, `remediable`, `documentLanguage`, `pdfHasFormFields`, `pdfHasSignatures`, `pdfProducer`, `pdfCreator`, `pdfCreationDate`, `docxImageCount`. *(Implementation pending Phase 6.)*
