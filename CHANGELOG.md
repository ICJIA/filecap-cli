# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.4.0] — 2026-05-08

### Added

- **Filename heuristic flags.** Every entry's `flags[]` array is now populated with applicable flags from the Phase 4 taxonomy: `scanned-name-pattern` (Scan_*, IMG_*, Document\d+, Untitled*, all-digit, DOC\d+, FAX*, "Microsoft Word - *"), `filename-has-spaces`, `filename-non-ascii`, `filename-long` (>200 chars). Pure regex matching against the basename — no new runtime dependencies.
- New programmatic export from package main: `computeFilenameFlags(filename)`. Returns a sorted string array of applicable flags.

### Changed

- The orchestrator's entry construction switches `flags: []` to `flags: computeFilenameFlags(filename)`. Phase 1–3 entries had empty `flags[]` arrays; Phase 4 entries populate them. Backward-compatible at the schema level (still `z.array(z.string())`).

## [0.3.0] — 2026-05-08

### Added

- **DOCX introspection** via `jszip` + `fast-xml-parser`. Each DOCX entry now carries: `hasHeadings`, `imageCount`, `altTextCoverage`, `tableCount`, `tablesHaveHeaders`, `hyperlinkCount`, `vagueLinkCount` (count of "click here" / "read more" anti-patterns), and `documentLanguage`.
- **XLSX introspection** via `exceljs`. Each XLSX entry now carries: `sheetCount`, `sheetNames`, `defaultSheetNameCount` (count of `Sheet1`/`Sheet2`/etc.), `hasHeaderRows`, `mergedCellCount`, `hasCharts`, `hasImages`.
- **Legacy Office presence flag.** `.doc`, `.ppt`, and `.xls` files now carry an `introspection` block with `kind: "office-legacy"` and the specific format. No deep parsing; the marker indicates the file needs manual review.
- **Discriminated-union schema.** `entrySchema.introspection` is now `z.discriminatedUnion("kind", [...])` over `pdf`, `docx`, `xlsx`, `office-legacy`. Each variant has its own typed shape.
- New schema exports: `docxIntrospectionSchema`, `xlsxIntrospectionSchema`, `legacyOfficeIntrospectionSchema`.
- New programmatic exports from package main: `introspectDocx`, `introspectXlsx`, `introspectLegacyOffice`.

### Known limitations

- PPTX is not introspected in Phase 3 — entries with `extension: "pptx"` get no introspection block. Deferred to a future phase.
- DOCX language detection reads `word/styles.xml` first; some documents place language declarations elsewhere (e.g., `word/document.xml` `sectPr`). Coverage is best-effort; rare DOCX variants may report no language even when one is declared. A corrupt `word/styles.xml` falls through gracefully to the `document.xml` fallback (Phase 3 review fix).
- DOCX heading detection looks for style names matching `Heading[1-9]`; corporate templates with custom heading style names (e.g., `ChapterTitle`, `Titre 1`) will not be detected.
- XLSX chart detection uses `worksheet.model.charts`, which is populated inconsistently across `exceljs` versions. False negatives are possible for files with charts.
- DOCX image alt-text coverage tests don't currently exercise the non-zero path (the `docx` library's image API is awkward for runtime fixtures); the code path is verified against real-world Word documents.

[0.3.0]: https://github.com/ICJIA/filecap-cli/releases/tag/v0.3.0

## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-08

### Added

- **PDF introspection** via `pdfjs-dist`. Each PDF entry now carries an `introspection` block with: `pageCount`, `hasTextLayer` + `textLayerCoverage`, `isImageOnly`, `hasTags`, `hasOutline`, `hasFormFields`, `hasSignatures`, `encrypted`, `documentLanguage`, `producer`, `creator`, `creationDate`, `pdfVersion`, and `isLinearized`.
- **Empty-on-failure handling.** When `pdfjs-dist` cannot parse a file (malformed, encrypted-without-password, exotic variant), the entry's `introspection` key is omitted entirely. The file row still appears with full filesystem stats; the footer's `introspectionFailures` count increments. The empty field itself is the signal: "this file needs a closer look."
- **`--no-introspect` CLI flag.** Skip introspection for fast triage scans (filesystem-only).
- **`--max-introspect-mb <n>` CLI flag** (default 200). Skip introspection for files larger than this — a parse-cost guard for pathological inputs.
- **Introspection dispatcher** (`src/introspect/index.js`). Routes by extension to the appropriate introspector; returns `null` for non-introspectable types or oversized files. Phase 3 will add DOCX/XLSX entries to the dispatcher.
- New schema export: `pdfIntrospectionSchema` (Zod) for validating introspection blocks. `entrySchema` now accepts an optional `introspection` field.
- New programmatic exports from package main: `introspect`, `introspectPdf`, `pdfIntrospectionSchema`.

### Changed

- The scan orchestrator now defaults to introspecting (`introspect: true` at the CLI layer); pass `--no-introspect` to opt out. Phase 1's behavior was equivalent to `--no-introspect`. **This is a user-visible default-behavior change between v0.1.0 and v0.2.0.**

### Known limitations

- Test fixtures don't currently cover tagged, encrypted, or signed PDFs (`pdf-lib` cannot synthesize them at runtime). The detection paths for these features are exercised against real PDFs in production use; we plan to add committed fixtures or alternative synthesis in a future patch.

[0.2.0]: https://github.com/ICJIA/filecap-cli/releases/tag/v0.2.0

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-08

### Added

- Initial design document at `docs/filecap-design.md`.
- Project metadata: `README.md`, `LICENSE` (MIT), `.gitignore`, `CHANGELOG.md`.
- `filecap scan <directory>` command — recursive filesystem walk, per-file stats (size, mtime, extension), category derivation, optional SHA-256 hashing, and NDJSON output (header + entries + footer).
- `-o -` stdout-output convention: `filecap scan /path -o -` writes NDJSON to stdout, enabling SSH-piped multi-server orchestration without round-tripping files.
- Bounded concurrency for hashing via `p-limit`.
- Permission-denied handling: per-directory errors are captured and counted in the footer's `permissionDenials`; scan exits with code 3 (partial completion) when any directory was unreadable.
- TOCTOU resilience: files deleted between walk and stat are silently skipped; stat-level permission errors are counted alongside hash-level ones.
- Consistent error contract: `runScan` always returns `{exitCode, error?}`; never throws.
- Zod schemas validating header, entry, and footer NDJSON lines.
- Sample bash orchestrator at `examples/multi-scan.sh` for SSH-piped multi-server scans.
- Publish script (`./publish`) for npm releases.

### Design decisions locked

- **Output format.** NDJSON (`.ndjson`) for both single-instance scans and consolidated rollups.
- **Rollup canonical-row semantics.** One row per physical copy; content-duplicates carry a `duplicateOf` field (oldest `modifiedAt` wins; alphabetical tiebreaker on `serverName`). *(Implementation pending Phase 5.)*
- **PDF introspection failure handling.** Empty fields, no stub error block. *(Implementation pending Phase 2.)*
- **Hash algorithm.** SHA-256 via Node native `crypto`.
- **Vendor workflow.** Out of scope. filecap is a pure inventory tool.
- **CSV column additions.** `category`, `remediable`, `documentLanguage`, `pdfHasFormFields`, `pdfHasSignatures`, `pdfProducer`, `pdfCreator`, `pdfCreationDate`, `docxImageCount`. *(Implementation pending Phase 6.)*
